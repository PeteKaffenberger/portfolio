            <p class="about-me-text">
                I’ve always loved to build things and solve problems. Whether the job required swinging a hammer or
                wiring a switch, I’ve experienced great enjoyment in working with my hands and collaborating on projects
                with members of my team. Despite this satisfaction, there came a time when I wanted more from a career.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me-text">
                I went back to school and earned a B.A. in psychology from Temple University, embarking on a career in
                mission-based work for a nonprofit. I took great pride in working with our team to develop systems that
                measure and evaluate our organization’s impact on participants. After maintaining these systems for a
                few years, I was ready for a new challenge. I wanted to find a career that could incorporate both the
                satisfaction I felt working in the building trades, and the deeper thinking and problem solving I
                experienced in college and in the nonprofit sector. A career in web development made perfect sense to
                me.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me-text">
                I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp offered through The University of Pennsylvania’s College of
                Liberal and Professional Studies. Through this program I am determined to build the knowledge and skills
                I’ll need to pursue my dream career—one that will have endless space to learn, build, problem-solve, and
                collaborate.
